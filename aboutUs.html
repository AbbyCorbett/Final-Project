            <h2>What we are</h2>
            <p>We are a travel agency that help our clients discover the best destinations in the United States. We operate in several states from the West to East Coast. We also work with airlines in order to recommend the best deals. Similar to many other travel websites, we try to keep up to date in what consumers are looking for, weather and seasons.</p> <br>
            <p>The more visitors we have to our website, the better we can gauge what people want to see or where they want to go. We hope to expand our list to more states in the future as we have gotten many requests to do so</p>
